# The-Portal-Game
Simple game about spending one day in the college transfer portal. You make a few choices, deal with messages from coaches and social media noise, and try not to lose your mind. Each decision affects your options and how the day ends. There is no right answer, just tradeoffs. The goal is to finish the day in a good spot, or at least still sane.
